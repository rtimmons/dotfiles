dotfiles
========

    My dotfiles >> your dotfiles

I jumped the shark (er..the boat) and switched to zsh. While poking around I found [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and decided to blatantly copy a lot of his stuff.

Urgent TODOs
------------

- Replace `$+commands[FOO]` with `command -v FOO >/dev/null 2>&1`
- Figure out why we're slow: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327

Bootstrap
---------

    cd ~/Projects
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/rtimmons/dotfiles.git
    rake update
    rake install

(Can actually be cloned anywhere)

Local Configs
-------------

Be sure to see zsh/zshrc.symlink for details on how to set configuration that takes effect before/after configs in this project are executed.

.0zhrc?
-------

tl;dr:

> Everything ending in .0zshrc is sourced before everything ending in .zshrc

Everything in this repo that ends in `.zshrc` is sourced upon startup. (Check out `zsh/zshrc.symlink`.) Problem is there are bootstrap issues. Some things depend on other things. Apparently I can't pass a custom comparator into zsh's globbing, so it's impossible to, say, run everything in asciibetical order based on `basename` of the file. If it were, you could just name your files `000-prompt.zshrc` or whatever.


TODO
----


- 2017-12-08: configure completion to complete files if no other completion is applicable.
- 2017-11-09: `t` to emulate generating timestamps for natural-language dates

        cd $ZSH
        npm install locutus
        node -r $ZSH/node_modules/locutus -e \
            "console.log(require('locutus/php/datetime/strtotime')(Array.prototype.slice.call(process.argv, 1).join(' ')))" \
            now

    need some "vendor install" concept to do the `npm install` bits. Also remove relevant `.gitignore` entries.

I've stolen almost everything here.  I usually put the original source URL in comments next to the stolen bits.  Please contact me if I've stolen something and you want it back.
