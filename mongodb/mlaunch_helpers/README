This directory contains helper scripts to link
- mlaunch  (from mtools)
- m

together.
Basically, all releases are managed under m, and the clusters started by 'mlaunch'.

Customize your cluster by changing the following files:
- VERSION
- PORT
- init

Then:
- create and start a cluster with './init'
- stop a cluster with 'mlaunch stop'
- restart a cluster with './start' 
- reinitiate a cluster by first removing the 'data' directory (ensure all mongo processes are dead too)
- start a mongo shell to the primary port of the cluster with './mongo'
