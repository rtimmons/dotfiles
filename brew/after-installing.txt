    The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf to 8080 so that
    lighttpd can run without sudo.

    To have launchd start lighttpd at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/lighttpd/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load lighttpd now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.lighttpd.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        lighttpd -f /usr/local/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
