brew caveats:

    As of go 1.2, a valid GOPATH is required to use the `go get` command:
      https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

    You may wish to add the GOROOT-based install location to your PATH:
      export PATH=$PATH:/opt/boxen/homebrew/opt/go/libexec/bin

(Done in go/env.zshrc)

things I like installed:

    go get github.com/atotto/clipboard
    go get github.com/robbiev/numberwang
