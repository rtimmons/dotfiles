To have launchd start redis at login:
  ln -sfv /opt/boxen/homebrew/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load redis now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  redis-server /opt/boxen/homebrew/etc/redis.conf
