dotfiles
========

    My dotfiles >> your dotfiles

I jumped the shark (er..the boat) and switched to zsh. While poking around I found [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and decided to blatantly copy a lot of his stuff.

Urgent TODOs
------------

- Yay none right now.

Bootstrap
---------

    cd ~/Projects
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/rtimmons/dotfiles.git
    rake update
    rake install

(Can actually be cloned anywhere)

Local Configs
-------------

Be sure to see zsh/zshrc.symlink for details on how to set configuration that takes effect before/after configs in this project are executed.

.0zhrc?
-------

tl;dr:

> Everything ending in .0zshrc is sourced before everything ending in .zshrc

Everything in this repo that ends in `.zshrc` is sourced upon startup. (Check out `zsh/zshrc.symlink`.) Problem is there are bootstrap issues. Some things depend on other things. Apparently I can't pass a custom comparator into zsh's globbing, so it's impossible to, say, run everything in asciibetical order based on `basename` of the file. If it were, you could just name your files `000-prompt.zshrc` or whatever.

            now

    need some "vendor install" concept to do the `npm install` bits. Also remove relevant `.gitignore` entries.
